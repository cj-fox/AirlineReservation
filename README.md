# AirlineReservation
This program allows users to reserve a seat on an airline based on user input.
The program requests inputs from the user such as the class of seat, the row within that class, and the seat letter.
User input is validated against a list of valid inputs and validates that the requested seat is not already reserved.
If this seat is a valid option and is available, it will be reserved and the user will be asked if they want to reserve another
seat - which they can continue to do until they opt not to reserve another seat.
